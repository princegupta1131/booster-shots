It is important to understand that such regulation is a skill developed through voluntary practice and not as a fearful response to a threat. Emotional development can truly occur only in a compassionate environment \n• Social Development: The foundation for the development of ethical, humanistic, and constitutional values is social intelligence. The development of such intelligence starts early with the interaction of others and, through these interactions, recognising the needs and emotional states of others. This other regarding, along with recognition of diversity of background and needs of others, develops valuable capacities in young children.",
